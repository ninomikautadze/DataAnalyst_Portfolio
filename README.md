# DataAnalyst_Portfolio

This data analytics project focuses on analyzing customer behavior within the banking sector. Leveraging a dataset from a bank database, the analysis examines the relationship between customer service requests, approval rates, income levels, and return frequency. SQL queries are used to extract and clean the data, incorporating single-row functions, CASE WHEN statements, and analytical functions such as ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, and LAG. In Power BI, the project utilizes various features including calculated columns with DAX functions, IF statements, measures, slices, a clear filter button, conditional formatting, and demonstrates two table relationships. The goal is to uncover insights that can inform strategic decision-making within the banking industry.


Key Features:

•	Utilized SQL queries to extract and clean data from the bank database.

•	Employed Power BI for data visualization, creating insightful reports and dashboards.

•	Investigated the impact of service requests on approval rates and financial outcomes.

•	Analyzed customer income levels as a potential factor influencing service approval and financial decisions.

•	Classified customers based on return frequency, categorizing them into groups such as "Fast Returners" (1-6 months) and others.


Through this project, valuable insights were gained into customer behavior patterns, enabling better understanding and strategic decision-making within the banking sector
